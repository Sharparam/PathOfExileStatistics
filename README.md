Path of Exile Statistics
========================

Android app for the Path of Exile game
--------------------------------------

Shows leaderboard statistics from the game Path of Exile by Grinding Gear Games.

This app is in no way affiliated with or endorsed by Grinding Gear Games, it is an unofficial app showing stats from the game.

Currently, Default and Hardcore leagues are supported and can be switched from the app menu.

Manual refresh is available, and will refresh all entries currently loaded in the list (this could take a lot of time if you have a lot of entries loaded), the "Reset" menu option can be selected to reset the list back to the initial 200 entries.

Each tap on "Load more entries" at the bottom of the list will load an additional 200 entries from the ladder.
